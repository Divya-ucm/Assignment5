1. Implement Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library
Use dataset available with name glass
Use train_test_split to create training and testing part
Evaluate the model on test part using score and
classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

SOLUTION:
--------
Loading the glass dataset by using read_csv() function and then spliting the data set into features and targets after that spliting the data into training and test sets and then training the model by using the Naive bayes method and then predicting & evaluating the dataset.

2. Implement linear SVM method using scikit library
Use the same dataset above
Use train_test_split to create training and testing part
Evaluate the model on test part using score and
classification_report(y_true, y_pred)


SOLUTION:
---------
Getting the glass dataset by using read_csv() function and then spliting the data set into features and targets after that spliting the data into training and test sets and then training the model by using the Naive bayes method and then predicting & evaluating the dataset.
