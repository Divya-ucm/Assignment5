1. Implement Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library
Use dataset available with name glass
Use train_test_split to create training and testing part
Evaluate the model on test part using score and
classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

SOLUTION:
--------
Loading the glass dataset by using read_csv() function and then spliting the data set into features and targets after that spliting the data into training and test sets by using train_test_split() and then training the model by using the Naive bayes method and then predicting & evaluating the dataset.

2. Implement linear SVM method using scikit library
Use the same dataset above
Use train_test_split to create training and testing part
Evaluate the model on test part using score and
classification_report(y_true, y_pred)


SOLUTION:
---------
Getting the glass dataset by using read_csv() function and then spliting the data set into features and targets after that spliting the data into training and test sets by using train_test_split() and then training the model by using the Naive bayes method and then predicting & evaluating the dataset.

while comparing the two algorithms linear SVM has more accuracy compared to Navies bayes of linear svm=0.51 & navies bayes accuracy =0.37 moreover we can see the different parameters like precision,f1-score support parameters of linear svm algorithm are having high values compared to Nayes baye algorithm.
